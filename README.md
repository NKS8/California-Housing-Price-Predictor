## Supervised Machine Learning Model on Housing Price Prediciton 

In this project, different Supervised Machine Learning models are compared and tested by their scores, and the best model is chosen to predict Housing Price. In order to improve an accuracy of price prediction, the chosen best model is refined by using feature selection method. After model is refined, model is needed to predict housing price. Finally, comparisons, test scores, and housing price predictions are visualized on website that used technologies such as HTML, CSS, D3, JavaScript, Flasks.
