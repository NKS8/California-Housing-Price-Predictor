## Supervised Machine Learning Model on Housing Price Prediciton 

In this project, different Supervised Machine Learning Models are compared and tested by their scores, and the best scored Model is chosen to predict Housing Price. In order to improve an accuracy of price prediction, the chosen best model is refined by using feature selection method. After model is refined, model is needed to predict housing price. Finally, comparisons, test scores, and housing price prediction are visualized on website that used various technologies such as HTML, CSS, D3, JavaScript, Flasks. 
0. Web application: 
a. Model Comparisons.

Full lists of technologies are used to complete this project. 
1. Technologies used:
    * Sklearn
    * NumPy
    * Pandas 
    * Matplotlib
    * HTML
    * CSS
    * Javascript
    * D3
    * BootStrap
    * Flask
    * Python
    * Jupyter notebook 
2. In order to accomplish the project following steps are taken:
   * Data is researched from various sources such as Kaggle.com and Data.com, 
   * collected raw data 
   * cleaned data by dropping na's, by filling na's, and dropped columns those not useful for Machine Learning. 
   * preprocessed by applying encoding and split, train, and test for Machine Learning.
    
3. Once data is ready applied it into different Machine Learning models. Compared their test scores and apllied scaling as well.
4.  Chose the model scored best to predict housing price.
5.  Refined the chosen best scored model selected_features to improve test score and accuracy of housing price prediction.
6.  Predicted Housing price using the best scored Machine Learning Model.
7.  The comparisons and analysis of differnt models and price predictions are visualized on the website that used HTML, CSS, Flask, Python, D3, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and JQuery.
